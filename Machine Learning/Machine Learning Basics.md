# Machine Learning Basics

## 1. What is ML?
    - Limitations of explicit programming
      - Spam filter: many rules
      - Automatic driving: too many rules
    - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

## 2. What is learning?
    - Supervised Learning: learning with labeled examples - training set
    - Unsupervised Learning: un-labled data - Google news grouping, Word clustering    
    
## 3. What is Supervised learning?
    - Most common problem type in ML
    - Examples
      - Image labeling: learning from tagged images
      - Email spam filter: laerning from labeled(spam or ham) email
      - Predicting exam score: learning from previous exam score and time spent
    - Types of supervised learning
      - Regression: Predicting final exam score based on time spent
      - Binary Classification: Pass/Non-pass based on time spent
      - Multi-label Classification: Letter grade(A,B,C,E and F) based on time spent
