# TensorFlow Basics

## 1. What is TensorFlow
    - An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence from Google
    - Top deep learning libraries
    - An open-source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. (Python!)
    
## 2. What is Data Flow Graph?
    - Nodes in the graph: mathematical operations
    - Edges in the graph: multidimensional data arrays(tensors) communicated between them
